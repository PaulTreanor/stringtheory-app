**Description**

The Chord Learning App is an android app that will allow users to learn and practice guitar chords without a guitar. This will be especially useful for those who travel a lot, use public transport, or for beginners who can&#39;t practice on a real guitar for long without their fingers hurting.

The app will essentially turn the phone&#39;s screen into a fretboard, divided into 4 frets with the 6 strings displayed above. The user will hold the phone like the neck of a guitar and as they push down on the displayed strings the note associated with the string in that position will be played. Certain combinations of notes will play chords and will produce different sounds.

The app will guide the user as to where their fingers should be placed to achieve the desired chord. When the user&#39;s finger placement is correct the app will give the user feedback via the phone vibrating. They will also know that the chord is either wrong or right depending on the sound the phone produces as they press their fingers down. Since chords are made up of individual notes and a guitar can only play a set number of notes, making chords is a matter of playing the sounds of notes together.

Since the app is aimed at beginners learning the guitar we will make it focused on learning basic chords. The app will teach all the major and minor open chords in a series of lessons and allow the user to test their skills by practicing some songs using the chords they have learned.
